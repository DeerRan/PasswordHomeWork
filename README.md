# PasswordHomeWork
Homework for my Bootcamp, mimicking the functionality of a password generator

# Description
This repository contains HTML, CSS, and JS files that all work together to create a password generator. 

# index.HTML
This file contains divs to create the bones of the webpage and also has a form for user input. 
Based on what boxes the user will check, the password generator will react accordingly.
I reformatted and added a form to the HTML in order to complete the requirements.

# style.css
This file contains the code needed to make the page look nice and also allows it to adjust to different widths (precoded for me). 
I made minor adjustments to the css as I needed to given that I had to restructure or add some HTML elements to complete the requirements.

# testscript.js
This file contains the javascript code needed to actually generate the password and allow users' inputs to be recieved. The file is named testscript because I had taken inspiration from a different format of a generator initially, but could not debug my code due to a lack of understanding on my end of new materials learned. So I restarted using a more simpler structure and approach from a different inspiration. Assuming the new code would also fail, I had named it "testscript" with the intentions of scrapping it, however it did end up working!

There are minor notes within the javascript that explain certain blocks of code. The explinations may not be clear but hopefully it's understandable.
